# Basic-Contract(DigitalCNIC)
This Contact is simply use to create CNIC number for citizen.

# Functionality
Citizen will give his first name & Last name and inreturn he will receive his/her ID card number, CNIC issued date, and CNIC Expiry date.

This is the very basic level contract that gives basis to new developers to understand some of the basic Operations like Conversion
form TimeStamp to human readable date, how to concat two String, and how to have typeCasting.

Idea behind DigitalCNIC is that, as we know that every block has unique number in Block Chain therfore assigning newly created 
Blocknumber as a CNIC number, its created date as a CNIC issued date ,and adding 10 years for its expiry date are main things in this contract.
